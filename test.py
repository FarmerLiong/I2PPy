# longText= """Let me tell you what this book is not. It is not about religion.
# It is not about telling you how to live your life. It is not about taking on a new set of beliefs.
# Plain and simple, it's about how to relate to your own thoughts and emotions in a way that makes
# your life more enjoyable, more free, brighter, clearer and wiser. We like to think we understand what
# is happening around us; that we can determine the path our life takes.
# But often, things do not go that way - in fact, they rarely do. What helps us respond to life as it unfolds?
# To live freely, stay humble and find comfort in difficult times? In the Swedish sensation I May Be Wrong,
# former forest monk Bj√∂rn Natthiko Lindeblad shares his advice on how to face the uncertainty and doubt
# that is a natural part of life. We don't choose our thoughts. We don't control the shape they take,
# or what pops into our minds. We can only choose whether or not to believe them. Infusing the
# everyday with heart, grace and gentle humour, this is a book to help us all navigate the realities of modern life."""
